# Game_OOP
Simple game about a flying dog where I was learning OOP paradigm. Made by me from scratch.

made in: Python version 3.7

Why:
My main goal of this project was to challenge myself with an Object Oriented Programming paradigm, as well as giving a tribute to my best friend, the dog Venom (has quite a character).
Game was made mainly using Sprite objects in pygame. Also, I placed strong emphasis to keep the code easy to review, easy to expand in future and as short as it can be, due to
well implemented inheritance of objects.

Game consists of three stages:
- intro (which is just a basic displaying images with delay),
- game itself (where player is flying, killing birds with fire balls, destroying enemy towers with bombs),
- manual menu (where player sees his score and is acknowledged of controls).

This game would not be possible without graphics and sounds, so here's my appreciation for:
